COVID-19 created an alarming situation for people who were already below the poverty line, as they did not have even odd jobs to work during this difficult time.
                                            We are making constant efforts to reach out to families in dire need with the help of our campaign, Garib Parivar Ration Yojana (GPRY). Under this campaign. we provide monthly ration to families that are associated with us every month. All these families are provided with Ration Cards, and they receive a grocery kit at the beginning of every month.
                                            There are many families that need your help in these difficult time and we are putting in all possible efforts to help more and more such families throughout India. The Garib Parivar Ration Yojana provides underprivileged families with food supplies like wheat flour, pulses, cooking oil and spices, etc. Each family is provided with a monthly supply to ensure that no one in their families has to go to bed hungry.

If left untreated, tumours can grow and spread into the surrounding normal tissue, or to other parts of the body via the bloodstream and lymphatic systems, and can affect the digestive, nervous and circulatory systems or release hormones that may affect body function. At certain times of the year, we mark awareness days, weeks or months to help spread the word about how to help prevent different kinds of cancers, and how to spot them early. The emerging India helps to aware the people about this .

                        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>Meaning of road safety
                            Road safety teaches people how to conduct themselves while driving or crossing roads. Road safety measures, including the use of road barriers and highway barriers, are aimed at reducing the risks of people getting involved in accidents in the first place. Following these measures, the chances of accidents, injuries and damage to property are vastly reduced.
                            Importance of road safety
                            There is a constant uptick in the number of vehicles on the road. If you feel that the traffic conditions are bad right now, they will only worsen in the upcoming years unless people follow road safety measures and traffic awareness to make life easier for everyone.
                            There are a few factors that lead to such accidents in the country. Some of them are unsafe driving, disregard for traffic rules and regulations, users refraining from using helmets and seat belts and so on.
                            The government of India follows road safety week between the 11th to 17th of January. Road safety awareness week aims at improving road safety awareness across the country with the help of a few methods, including pedestrian safety, road safety signage, and road and safety.
                            Key objectives of road safety week
                            It is essential to drive at slower speeds. Research shows that for an increase of 1% in speed, the chances of accidents increase by 4%.
                            One must altogether avoid the usage of phones or other gadgets for any sort of activities that can be distracting. It is hazardous as it reduces the reaction time, making it difficult to react to changes.
                            Using a good helmet while riding a bike is critical, irrespective of whether you are riding or being a pillion rider. The presence of a helmet can reduce the risk of severe accidents and death by a considerable margin.
